# PlexAppChecker

This script is for macOS only.  It checks if the Plex Media Server App is running on your Mac and if the app has crashed, will relaunch it.  There is also logging built in.  Make sure you customize the variables as needed.  To make it effiecient, I added it to a cronjob.

This script was created due to an issue where the PMS app was consistantly crashing for a while and it saved time in having to check and relaunch the app.
